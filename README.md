profiles
========

Here are some profiles that I am using, and perhaps others will find them useful.

8021xDisable.mobileconfig - Unchecks the "Enable automatic connection" checkbox for 802.1X in Network Preferences.  This was build by grabbing the plist and using Tim Sutton's mxcToProfile tool

Office2011Prefs.mobileconfig - Disables first run splash screens for Offce 2011 apps.  Based on plists from William Smith and converted with Tim Sutton's mxcToProfile tool
